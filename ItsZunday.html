<h2>Lyrics:</h2>

Went to a record store to get some CDs
went to the aisles and made sure nobody can see me
I was checking out the albums and i looked at the price tags
and ingored them and stuffed them into my bag

Check your calenders cause its Zunday
now its time for you to go insane
Do what ever cause the laws dont mean anything
anymore cause its zunday

What, you dont know about zunday, no ones ever told you
on that date, chaos controls you
Everybody in rage, cause thats the day there supposed to
and its zunday, so lets go bazooks

Check your calenders cause its Zunday
now its time for you to go insane
Do what ever cause the laws dont mean anything
anymore cause its zunday

run out the record store 
kick down the door
and run to the super market so i can get more

Steal all the cereal shoes and chip bags
and steal form the cash register so i can get cash and get rich fast

Look up at the bloody red sky and see floating turtle eyes
and next to where a million guys
shooting missles and
chocolate bars from switzerland

Check your calenders cause its Zunday
now its time for you to go insane
Do what ever cause the laws dont mean anything
anymore cause its zunday
