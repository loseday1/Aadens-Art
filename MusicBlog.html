      <img src="Screenshot 2025-08-01 10.47.03 PM.png">
      <p>Also, i have changed the title, its now titled "Chatter Box". I am also gonna change the rest on the album art. The reason i made this decision is because i think the oringinal cover and title wasn't creative, and the reason i changed the rest of the album art is so it will fit the new cover and name.</p>
