  <h1>Insert Title</h1>
  <p>So, i know his isn't like my other blog posts but, today at my school, we had free time on our computers and my friend 
    Silas decided to freaking show everyone in the class my site. Im not to annoyed by it, it is free promotion but it was
    embarrassing. He showed them my films, animations and my music, some people called it cringe and other negitive terms, 
  but most said nothing.</p>
