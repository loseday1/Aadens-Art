<p>I wanna be famous
I'll do anything to make it
Happen
I have no passion, i just
wanna be famous
I'll do anything to make it
Happen
I have no passion.

I have no change in my wallet,
but i do have dollar bills.
I have attention,
but no skills.

Its not enough.(x2)

I need something to get my name out there,
and music is the thing i'll make.
I dont have to put in any care,
i'll just do it and get paid.

I wanna be famous
I'll do anything to make it
Happen
I have no passion, i just
wanna be famous
I'll do anything to make it
Happen
I have no passion.

I dont make music for me.
I just wanna  get money and leave.
Soon i'll be swimming in paper that i think has a value.
I know i shoudn't be doing this, but i have to.

I wanna be famous
I'll do anything to make it
Happen
I have no passion, i just
wanna be famous
I'll do anything to make it
Happen
I have no passion.

I wanna be famous
I'll do anything to make it
Happen
I have no passion, i just
wanna be famous
I'll do anything to make it
Happen
I have no passion.</p>
